# MLFlow Server Proxy 

MLFlow Server Proxy lets you run arbitrary external MLFlow tracking server alongside your notebook server and provide authenticated web access to them using a path `/mlflow` next to others like `/lab`. 

Alongside the python package that provides the main functionality, the JupyterLab extension [@jupyterlab/server-proxy](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy) provides buttons in the JupyterLab launcher window to get to MLFlow tracking server.

This package was built using the [`jupyter-server-proxy` cookiecutter template](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/tree/master/contrib/template).

##  ü§π‚ÄçInstallation

### Python package
You can currently install this package from PyPI.

```bash
pip install mlflow-server-proxy
```

To install with all the resources then use 

```bash
pip install 'mlflow-server-proxy[resources]'
```
The above command will install MLFlow as well.

##  ü§π‚ÄçSetup 

The environment variable `MLFLOW_STORE` has to be set as backend storage for MLFlow to log models and artifacts. Default is `/tmp`

This environment variable is then used in setting server uri while using MLFlow in your code as below:

```python
import mlflow

server_uri = os.environ["MLFLOW_STORE"]
mlflow.set_tracking_uri(server_uri)
```
## Requirements

#### Install MLFlow 

This package's executes the standard `mlflow server` command. This command assumes the `mlflow` executable required to start the application is globally available.

```bash
pip install mlflow
```

### Install Jupyter Notebook
